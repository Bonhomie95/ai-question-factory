GENERAL RULES:
- ALWAYS return valid JSON only. No commentary. No markdown.
- Output must be a JSON array of objects.
- Each object must contain:
  {
    "question": "...",
    "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    "answer": "A",
    "category": "<category>",
    "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard"
  }
- Avoid repeating any question that sounds similar to previous knowledge.
- Use global variation and avoid repeating the same style.
- Keep questions short, clear, factual, and interesting.
